Lua
------------------------------------------------------------

This is my own fork of Lua as of version 5.2.3 (11/11/2013)

Included is a VS2013 .sln.  The header files are duplicated into Include
and there are precompiled binaries for lua and luac for MSVC on x86 and x64.

I might add additional functionality like compound assignment operators
(e.g. +=, -=, etc...)

As with Lua this fork is licensed under the MIT License.


Original Lua README follows...
-------------------------------------------------------------

This is Lua 5.2.3, released on 11 Nov 2013.

For installation instructions, license details, and
further information about Lua, see doc/readme.html.
